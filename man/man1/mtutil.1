.SH SYNOPSIS
.P

.BI [ input ]
.B -sdr|-mij|-pnt|-mag|-mom|-ternary|-dcp|-sv|-kagan
.BI [ output ]
.BI [...]

.SH DESCRIPTION
.B mtutil
converts between earthquake source parameters. Inputs can be strike/dip/rake,
moment tensor components, moment tensor principal axes, seismic moment, or magnitude. Outputs can be
any of these values (when possible, e.g., you cannot convert a seismic moment to strike/dip/rake), a
ternary representation of the focal mechanism (Frohlich, 1992), double-couple percentage, slip vectors,
or the angle between two sources (Tape and Tape, 2012).
See Jost and Herrmann (1989) for more details.

If
.I input
is a file name, then
.B mtutil
will attempt to read inputs from that file.
If
.I input
is a comma-separated list of numbers, then inputs will be read this list of arguments.
If
.I input
is not provided, then
.B mtutil
will read from standard input.
.B mtutil
will print the results to standard output unless a file name is defined as
.IR output .

.B INPUTS

.TP
.BI "-sdr [" input_file | strike , dip , rake ]
.IR Strike ", " dip ", and " rake
as defined by Aki and Richards (2002).
.I Strike
is in degrees clockwise from north,
.I dip
is in degrees down from horizontal, and
.I rake
is in degrees counter-clockwise from the strike-parallel direction along the fault plane.

.TP
.BI "-mij [" input_file | mrr , mtt , mpp , mrt , mrp , mtp ]
Moment tensor components as published by the Global CMT project
(Gilbert and Dziewonski, 1975; Ekstrom et al., 2012), where
.I r
is the radial (unit vector corresponds to vertical) direction,
.I t
is co-latitude (unit vector corresponds to south), and
.I p
is longitude (unit vector corresponds to east).

Ekstrom et al. (2012) define a geographic Cartesian coordinate system for the
Global Centroid Moment Tensor project,
where
.IR x =north,
.IR y =east,
and
.IR z =down.
Some moment tensor solutions are reported in this
system (e.g., NIED F-net solutions from Japan). In this case:
.br
.IR mrr " =  mzz"
.br
.IR mtt " =  mxx"
.br
.IR mpp " =  myy"
.br
.IR mrt " =  mxz"
.br
.IR mrp " = -myz"
.br
.IR mtp " = -mxy"

Moment tensors behave similarly to stress tensors. You can use
.B mtutil
to compute the eigenvectors and eigenvalues of stress tensors using -mij and -pnt,
remembering to account for the coordinate transformation.
In local
.IR e ast,
.IR n orth,
and
.IR v ertical
(positive up) coordinates, the components of the tensor become:
.br
.IR mrr " =  mvv"
.br
.IR mtt " =  mnn"
.br
.IR mpp " =  mee"
.br
.IR mrt " = -mnv"
.br
.IR mrp " =  mev"
.br
.IR mtp " = -men"
.br
The eigenvectors computed by
.B -pnt
are reported in the same x=east, y=north, z=vertical reference frame.

.TP
.BI "-pnt [" input_file | px , py , pz , nx , ny , nz , tx , ty , tz , pmag , nmag , tmag ]
Moment tensor eigenvectors and eigenvalues, also referred to as P (maximum compression), N
(neutral), and T (maximum tension) axes. Note:
.I pmag
is typically negative and
.I tmag
is typically positive.

.TP
.BI "-mag [" input_file | magnitude ]
Moment
.IR magnitude " = 2/3*log10(" moment ")-6.0,"
where the seismic moment is in N*m.

.TP
.BI "-mom [" input_file | moment ]
Seismic
.I moment
in N*m.

.TP
.B OUTPUTS
.TP
.BI "-sdr [" output_file ]
When used as the output option with
.B -sdr
as the input, prints
.IR strike ", " dip ", and " rake
of the second nodal plane. When used as the output option with
.B -mij
or
.BR -pnt ,
prints results for both nodal planes.
.TP
.BI "-mij [" output_file ]
Moment tensor components:
.IR  mrr ", " mtt ", " mpp ", " mrt ", " mrp ", and " mtp
.TP
.BI "-pnt [" output_file ]
Moment tensor eigenvectors (normalized to length=1) and eigenvalues:
.IR  px ", " py ", " pz ", " nx ", " ny ", " nz ", " tx ", " ty ", " tz ", " pmag ", " nmag ", and " tmag
.TP
.BI "-mag [" output_file ]
Moment
.IR magnitude " = 2/3*log10(" moment ")-6.0"
.TP
.BI "-mom [" output_file ]
Seismic
.I moment
in N*m.
.TP
.BI "-ternary [" output_file ]
Earthquake mechanism characterization from Frohlich (1992):
.IR fraction_thrust ", " fraction_strike-slip ", and " fraction_normal ,
which add up to one.
.TP
.BI "-dcp [" output_file ]
Double couple percentage:
.IR dcp =min(1-2*abs( nmag / pmag ),1-2*abs( nmag / tmag ))
.TP
.BI "-sv [" output_file ]
Slip vector
.IR east ,
.IR north ,
and
.I vertical
components
.TP
.BI "-kagan [" output_file ]
Angle between two sources, after Tape and Tape (2012). This is the minimum angle required to rotate
the first source into the second source. The input must contain two sources instead of one.

.TP
.B OTHER OPTIONS
.TP
.B -[non-]dc
The default behavior of
.B mtutil
is
.BR -dc ,
to use the scalar seismic moment for a double couple source to calculate the seismic moment
and moment magnitude, as defined in Jost and Herrmann (1989) Equation 19:
.br
    M0 = 1/2 * (|m1| + |m2|)
.br
where m1 and m2 are the two largest eigenvalues of the moment tensor (in an absolute sense). This
is the definition of the seismic moment used by the Global Centroid Moment Tensor catalog.
Specify
.B -non-dc
to instead use the scalar seismic moment for a full moment tensor (Jost and Herrmann, 1989
Equation 20):
.br
    M0 = sqrt((m1^2 + m2^2 + m3^2)/2)
.br
where m1, m2, and m3 are the eigenvalues of the moment tensor. This is the definition used by the
USGS and the scaling factor for GMT psmeca.
